# CodeJoint Logo
Note: the `test` folder was used to turn the image into an array so I could paste it into data.js. If you want to run it, do `npm install` in the folder, then run `node thing.js`. You can also change the image and create a new `hi.txt` file, which you can copy and paste into the `data.js` files

The folder `codejoint` has the code and html file. Figure out how to get it working yourself lol

Also, if you want to make a gif, use the `gif-creator` folder. Run `npm install`, then run `node creator.js`. ChatGPT was surprisingly helpful with writing the code lol.
